# 🔒📁 File Permissions in Linux for Research Team

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to ensure that the file permissions within the research team's directories are correctly configured to maintain system security. This involves reviewing current permissions, identifying any discrepancies, and making necessary adjustments to align with organizational policies.

## 📖 Scenario
As a security professional at a large organization, you are responsible for managing file permissions for the research team. This task includes verifying that users have appropriate access and modifying permissions to prevent unauthorized access. The organization policy states that no files should have write access for 'others', and certain sensitive directories should only be accessible by specific users.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🔐 Understanding of Linux file permissions.
- 🛠️ Ability to modify file and directory permissions using Linux commands.
- 📜 Knowledge of best practices for securing file systems in a multi-user environment.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 💻 Linux terminal for executing commands.
- 📝 Documentation tools for recording permissions and changes.
- 📘 Linux file system utilities (e.g., `ls`, `chmod`, `chown`).

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to manage and secure file permissions:

1. **🔍 Access Supporting Materials**
   - Review the scenario and guidelines.

2. **📊 Check File and Directory Details**
   - Use the `ls -la` command to check current file and directory permissions.

3. **🔎 Describe the Permissions String**
   - Describe the 10-character permission string for each file and directory.

4. **🚫 Identify Unauthorized Write Access**
   - Identify files with unauthorized write access and modify permissions.

5. **🔒 Change File Permissions on a Hidden File**
   - Modify permissions for hidden files to restrict write access.

6. **🔐 Change Directory Permissions**
   - Modify permissions for directories to restrict access based on organizational policies.

## 📜 Project Description
This project involves managing file permissions for a research team in a Linux environment. By reviewing and adjusting permissions, we ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive files and directories, enhancing overall system security.

## 📄 Summary
We examined existing file and directory permissions, identified discrepancies, and made necessary adjustments to align with organizational policies. Unauthorized write access was removed, and access to sensitive directories was restricted to specific users, ensuring proper authorization and security.
