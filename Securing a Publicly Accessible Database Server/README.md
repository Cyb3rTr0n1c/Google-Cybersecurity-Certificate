# 🔒🌐 Securing a Publicly Accessible Database Server

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to assess and secure a publicly accessible database server to protect sensitive business data from potential security threats. This involves identifying vulnerabilities, evaluating risks, and implementing security measures to safeguard the data.

## 📖 Scenario
As a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company, you are tasked with conducting a vulnerability assessment on a database server that has been open to the public. The server contains critical customer data used by remote employees for business operations. Your goal is to communicate the potential risks to decision-makers and propose security solutions.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🔐 Conducting a vulnerability assessment.
- 📊 Evaluating risk using NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines.
- 🛡️ Implementing security controls to mitigate identified risks.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 💻 NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines for risk assessment.
- 📝 Documentation tools for recording assessment results and recommendations.
- 🔧 Database and network security tools for implementing security measures.

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to conduct the vulnerability assessment and secure the database server:

1. **🔍 Access Supporting Materials**
   - Review the system description and scope of the assessment.

2. **✏️ Write the Purpose Statement**
   - Describe the reasons for conducting the vulnerability analysis.

3. **⚠️ Identify Threat Sources**
   - Identify three potential threats to the database server.

4. **🔎 Determine Threat Events**
   - Identify three possible threat events based on the identified threats.

5. **📈 Evaluate Risks**
   - Assess the likelihood and severity of each threat event and calculate the overall risk score.

6. **🔒 Propose Security Recommendations**
   - Recommend specific security controls to mitigate or remediate the identified risks.

## 📜 Project Description
This project involves performing a comprehensive vulnerability assessment on a publicly accessible database server. By identifying potential threats, evaluating risks, and recommending security measures, the aim is to enhance the server's security and protect critical business data.

## 📄 Summary
We conducted a vulnerability assessment on the company's database server, identified significant risks, and proposed security measures to mitigate these threats. By implementing multi-factor authentication, enforcing the principle of least privilege, and employing defense-in-depth strategies, we enhanced the security of the server, protecting it from unauthorized access and potential disruptions.
