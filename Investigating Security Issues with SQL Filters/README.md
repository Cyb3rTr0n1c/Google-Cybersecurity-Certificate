# 🔒🔍 Investigating Security Issues with SQL Filters

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to investigate potential security issues within an organization by examining employee and login attempt data using SQL filters. This involves retrieving specific records based on various conditions to identify and analyze suspicious activities.

## 📖 Scenario
As a security professional at a large organization, your task is to investigate security incidents by querying the `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables. You will use SQL filters to retrieve records that provide insights into login attempts and employee information, helping to address potential security concerns.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🔍 Proficiency in using SQL filters to query databases.
- 🛠️ Ability to retrieve and analyze specific datasets using conditions and patterns.
- 📊 Knowledge of SQL best practices for data security and analysis.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 💻 SQL database for executing queries.
- 📝 Documentation tools for recording queries and results.
- 📘 SQL query tools and commands (e.g., `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to investigate and secure the organization’s data:

1. **🔍 Access Supporting Materials**
   - Review the scenario and guidelines.

2. **🗄 Retrieve After Hours Failed Login Attempts**
   - Create a query to identify failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.

3. **📆 Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates**
   - Create a query to identify login attempts that occurred on specified dates.

4. **🌍 Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico**
   - Create a query to identify login attempts that did not originate from Mexico.

5. **🏢 Retrieve Employees in Marketing**
   - Create a query to identify employees in the Marketing department located in the East building.

6. **📊 Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales**
   - Create a query to identify employees in the Finance or Sales departments.

7. **🚫 Retrieve All Employees Not in IT**
   - Create a query to identify employees who are not in the IT department.

## 📜 Project Description
In this project, we investigate potential security issues by querying the `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables. Using SQL filters, we retrieve specific records to identify suspicious activities and ensure that appropriate security measures are taken.

## 📄 Summary
We created and explained SQL queries to filter data based on conditions such as failed login attempts after hours, login attempts on specific dates, and employee information from various departments. These queries help in identifying and addressing potential security issues within the organization.
