# 🔒📁 Risk Assessment for Bank Security

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a risk assessment for a commercial bank's operational environment. This involves evaluating potential risks to the bank's funds and prioritizing them based on likelihood and severity to focus on the most critical security threats.

## 📖 Scenario
Joining a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank, you are tasked with creating a risk register to assess and prioritize risks to the bank's funds. The bank operates in a coastal area with low crime rates and strict financial regulations. Various risks including business email compromise, compromised user database, financial records leak, theft, and supply chain disruptions have been identified.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🛡️ Risk assessment methodologies.
- 📊 Calculation of likelihood and severity scores.
- 🎯 Prioritization of security risks based on risk scores.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 📝 Risk register template for recording risks and scores.
- 📈 Risk matrix for scoring likelihood and severity.
- 📊 Calculation formula for determining risk priority scores.

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to conduct the risk assessment:

1. **📋 Access the Risk Register Template**
   - Review the scenario and access the provided risk register template.

2. **🔍 Evaluate Operating Environment Characteristics**
   - Consider the bank's location, number of employees, customer base, and regulatory requirements.

3. **🔎 Assess Likelihood Scores**
   - Estimate the likelihood of each identified risk (business email compromise, compromised user database, financial records leak, theft, supply chain disruption) based on available evidence and expert judgment.

4. **📊 Determine Severity Scores**
   - Evaluate the potential impact (severity) of each risk on the bank's operations, financial stability, and regulatory compliance.

5. **🔢 Calculate Priority Scores**
   - Calculate the risk priority score for each risk by multiplying the likelihood and severity scores.

## 📜 Project Description
This project involves assessing risks to a commercial bank's funds and prioritizing them based on likelihood and severity scores. By using a structured risk assessment approach, the cybersecurity team aims to identify and address the most critical security threats to safeguard the bank's assets and uphold regulatory requirements.

## 📄 Summary
The risk assessment identified potential security risks including business email compromise, compromised user database, financial records leak, theft, and supply chain disruptions. Likelihood and severity scores were calculated for each risk, and priority scores were determined to focus efforts on mitigating the most significant threats. This approach ensures proactive security measures are implemented to protect the bank's financial assets and maintain operational integrity.
