# 🛡️📉 Incident Report Analysis for Multimedia Company

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct an incident report analysis for a multimedia company offering web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services. The analysis will help identify the nature of the recent DDoS attack, the impact, and measures to prevent future incidents, following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

## 📖 Scenario
A multimedia company experienced a DDoS attack that disrupted internal network services for two hours. The attack involved a flood of ICMP packets due to an unconfigured firewall, leading to network unavailability. This analysis aims to detail the incident, assess the security measures taken, and recommend further actions to enhance the company's cybersecurity posture.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🔐 Understanding of network security and DDoS mitigation.
- 📑 Ability to document and report cybersecurity incidents.
- 💡 Development of proactive security measures to mitigate future risks.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 🛡️ Network monitoring software for detecting abnormal traffic patterns.
- 📝 Security incident report templates for documenting incidents.
- 🔧 IDS/IPS systems for filtering suspicious ICMP traffic.
- 📘 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) for structured analysis and response.

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to conduct the incident report analysis:

1. **🔍 Access Supporting Materials**
   - Review the scenario and guidelines:
     - Incident report analysis template
     - Applying the NIST CSF
     - Example of an incident report analysis

2. **📊 Identify**
   - Define the type of attack and impacted systems:
     - **Type of Attack:** DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
     - **Systems Impacted:** Internal network, network services

3. **🛡️ Protect**
   - Propose immediate actions to secure the organization's assets:
     - Update firewall configurations to limit ICMP packet rates.
     - Implement source IP address verification for incoming traffic.
     - Conduct regular training for network security staff.
     - Ensure all network devices and software are up-to-date and patched.

4. **🔎 Detect**
   - Enhance detection methods for future incidents:
     - Implement continuous network traffic monitoring.
     - Deploy network monitoring software to detect abnormal patterns.
     - Use IDS/IPS systems to filter out suspicious ICMP traffic.
     - Conduct regular network audits to identify vulnerabilities.
     - Set up logging and alerting systems for unauthorized access attempts.

5. **🚀 Respond**
   - Develop a response plan for future incidents:
     - Contain the incident by isolating affected systems.
     - Neutralize the threat by blocking malicious traffic and taking non-critical services offline.
     - Analyze the incident to understand the attack vector and affected systems.
     - Document lessons learned and update incident response plans.
     - Communicate with stakeholders about the incident and mitigation measures.

6. **🔧 Recover**
   - Outline steps to recover from the incident:
     - Restore affected systems to normal operation.
     - Recover and validate system data and assets.
     - Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement.
     - Update security policies and procedures based on the incident analysis.
     - Enhance disaster recovery plans for quicker recovery in future incidents.
