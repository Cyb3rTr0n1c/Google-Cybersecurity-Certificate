# 🛡️🔍 Analyzing Suspicious Files for Security Incident Response

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to assess the maliciousness of a suspicious file using a detailed step-by-step process, ultimately enhancing our threat detection and response capabilities. This involves retrieving and analyzing a VirusTotal report and documenting relevant Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

## 📖 Scenario
As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with investigating an alert about a suspicious file detected on the network. The investigation includes examining the file's hash, retrieving a detailed VirusTotal report, and documenting findings using a standardized template. This process will help determine the file's threat level and inform appropriate response actions.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🧠 Critical thinking and analytical skills for threat detection.
- 🔍 Expertise in using VirusTotal for file analysis.
- 📋 Proficiency in documenting Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
- 🛡️ Knowledge of best practices in incident response.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 🔐 VirusTotal for retrieving detailed file analysis.
- 💾 Template for documenting findings.
- 📂 Documentation tools for organizing and recording investigation results.

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to analyze the suspicious file and document findings:

1. **🔍 Access the Template**
   - Open the provided template to structure the analysis.

2. **📊 Review the Details of the Alert**
   - Examine the provided information, including the file's hash and event timeline.

3. **🌐 Retrieve VirusTotal Report**
   - Use VirusTotal to search for the file's SHA256 hash and obtain a detailed report.
     - **SHA256 file hash**: `54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b`
     - [VirusTotal Scan Results](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b/details)


4. **📝 Analyze VirusTotal Report**
   - Review the detection ratios, community feedback, and detailed behavioral analysis from VirusTotal.

5. **📋 Document IoCs**
   - Record relevant Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) based on the VirusTotal analysis.

6. **🔒 Fill Out the Template**
   - Complete the template with findings, including hash values, IP addresses, domains, and other IoCs.

## 📜 Project Description
This project involves a thorough investigation of a suspicious file detected on the network. By analyzing a VirusTotal report and documenting findings using a standardized template, we aim to determine the file's threat level and inform appropriate incident response actions.

## 📄 Summary
We accessed the analysis template, reviewed alert details, retrieved a VirusTotal report, and documented relevant Indicators of Compromise (IoCs). This structured approach ensured a comprehensive analysis of the suspicious file, enhancing our capability to detect and respond to potential threats effectively.
