# 🛡️🖥️ Investigating a Suspicious USB Drive

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to safely investigate a suspicious USB drive found in the hospital parking lot, using virtualization software to prevent potential security threats. This involves examining the contents of the USB drive and analyzing the risks associated with USB baiting attacks.

## 📖 Scenario
As a member of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital, you find a USB stick in the parking lot. To investigate without risking the hospital’s systems, you use a virtual environment. The USB contains a mix of personal and work-related files belonging to Jorge Bailey, the HR manager. Your task is to assess the types of information stored, understand potential threats, and identify measures to mitigate such risks.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 🔍 Understanding of USB security risks.
- 🛡️ Safe investigation techniques using virtualization software.
- 🧩 Risk analysis and mitigation strategies for USB baiting attacks.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 💻 Virtualization software for safe environment simulation.
- 📝 Documentation tools for recording findings and risk analysis.
- 📁 USB drive for content examination.

## 📝 Steps
Steps followed to investigate and secure the USB drive:

1. **🔍 Access Supporting Materials**
   - Review the scenario and guidelines.

2. **💻 Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Set up a virtual machine using the virtualization software to safely investigate the USB drive.

3. **📂 Plug in the USB Drive**
   - Connect the USB drive to the virtual machine to examine its contents.

4. **🔎 Review USB Contents**
   - Analyze the types of files stored on the USB drive and categorize them into personal and work-related information.

5. **🧠 Attacker Mindset Analysis**
   - Consider how the information on the USB could be used maliciously against Jorge Bailey or the hospital.

6. **⚠️ Risk Analysis**
   - Identify potential risks associated with USB baiting attacks and suggest technical, operational, and managerial controls to mitigate these risks.

## 📜 Project Description
This project involves the safe investigation of a suspicious USB drive using a virtual environment. By analyzing the contents and understanding the potential threats, we can develop strategies to mitigate risks associated with USB baiting attacks and enhance the hospital's overall security posture.

## 📄 Summary
We safely examined the USB drive's contents using a virtual machine, identified the types of stored information, and analyzed how this information could be exploited by an attacker. We also outlined technical, operational, and managerial controls to prevent and mitigate the risks associated with USB baiting attacks, ensuring the security of the hospital’s systems and data.
