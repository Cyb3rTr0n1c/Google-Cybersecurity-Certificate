# 🛡️📄 Algorithm for File Updates in Python

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to automate the process of updating an allow list of IP addresses that can access restricted content within a healthcare company's network. The process includes checking for any IP addresses that should be removed based on a provided remove list and updating the allow list accordingly.

## 📖 Scenario
As a security professional at a healthcare company, you are tasked with regularly updating a file containing an allow list of IP addresses. These IP addresses belong to employees who need access to restricted subnetwork areas to work with personal patient records. The project involves identifying and removing any IP addresses on a remove list from this allow list.

### 📚 Skills Learned
- 📄 File handling in Python.
- 🔄 String and list manipulation.
- 📝 Using control flow structures like loops and conditionals.
- 🔐 Best practices for maintaining secure access lists.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- 🐍 Python for scripting the automation process.
- 💻 Text editor or IDE for writing and testing Python code.
- 📄 File system for storing and managing IP address lists.

## 📝 Steps
Steps to automate the updating of the allow list file:

1. **📁 Access the Template**
   - Open the provided template and set up your environment.

2. **📂 Open the File that Contains the Allow List**
   - Use Python to open the `allow_list.txt` file for reading.

3. **📜 Read the File Contents**
   - Read the contents of the file and store them in a variable.

4. **🔄 Convert the String into a List**
   - Convert the string of IP addresses into a list for easier manipulation.

5. **🔍 Iterate through the Remove List**
   - Set up a loop to iterate through each IP address in the remove list.

6. **🚫 Remove IP Addresses that are on the Remove List**
   - Check if each IP address in the remove list is in the allow list and remove it if found.

7. **✏️ Update the File with the Revised List of IP Addresses**
   - Write the updated list of IP addresses back to the file.

## 📜 Project Description
This project focuses on automating the maintenance of an allow list of IP addresses for a healthcare company's restricted subnetwork. By developing a Python algorithm, the project ensures that any IP addresses that need to be removed, as identified on a remove list, are deleted from the allow list. This process helps maintain the security and integrity of the network by controlling access based on up-to-date permissions.

## 📄 Summary
The project involved creating a Python script to automate the management of an allow list of IP addresses. The script performs the following key functions:
1. Opens and reads the allow list file.
2. Converts the file contents from a string to a list.
3. Iterates through a remove list to identify and remove specific IP addresses.
4. Writes the updated list of IP addresses back to the file.

By automating this process, the project ensures that only authorized IP addresses have access to the restricted subnetwork, enhancing the overall security of the healthcare company's sensitive data.
